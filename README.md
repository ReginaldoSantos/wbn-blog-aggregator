# WBN Blog Aggregator

This project was bulit during some "Spring Web App Tutorial" I did.

And it is here for studying purposes like trying new stuff and new ideas so I don't need to start from scratch all the time.

# TODOs

1. Migrate from Apache Tiles to AngularJs or another client side technology.
2. Use Spring Environment Features: @Profile and @PropertySource
3. Try out Spring Cloud
